    <h2>The Polymath Playbook</h2>
    <p class="date">Jul 5, 2020</p>
    <p>You’ve likely heard the saying: “A jack of all trades is a master of none.” It warns against the futility of pursuing too many disciplines. Be a specialist, or you’ll be nothing.</p>
    <p>But there’s more to the story. An extended version of the saying tells a different tale: “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.” With a subtle addition, its meaning becomes inverted. It touts the benefits of being a polymath (a.k.a. generalist), rather than admonishing them.</p>
    <p>Why is the former so common, and the latter unknown?</p>
    <p>The answer lies in modern society’s preference for specialization. We’ll explore its origin, the limits it places on workers’ freedoms, and how the polymath approach can offer a reprieve. Finally, I’ll share my own experiences and learnings exploring a multitude of pursuits.</p>
